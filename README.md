open-attendee-tracker
=====================

Open Attendee Tracker is an opensource solution to the problem of conference attendee tracking for lead or attendance recording.  

Providing lead retrieval and attendance tracking at events is an expensive endeavour that requires the hiring of a lead retrieval firm, the rental of expensive scanners and often overlooks privacy for the attendee.  The Open Attendee Tracker is designed to provide a robust lead and attendance retrieval solution for event and conference organizers while respecting attendee privacy through a “secure by default” design.  Any Android or iOS device can be used instead of expensive scanner rentals, and the use of the software is free.  This not only provides huge savings for the organizers but allows for immediate distribution of leads to sponsors and other functionality that makes the solution a generally more robust experience for the attendees, the event sponsors and the event organizers.
